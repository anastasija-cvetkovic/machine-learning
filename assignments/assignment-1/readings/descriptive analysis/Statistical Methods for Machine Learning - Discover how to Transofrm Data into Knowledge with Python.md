Gaussian and Summary Stats

A sample of data is a snapshot from a broader population of all possible observations that
could be taken of a domain or generated by a process. Interestingly, many observations fit a
common pattern or distribution called the normal distribution, or more formally, the Gaussian
distribution. A lot is known about the Gaussian distribution, and as such, there are whole
sub-fields of statistics and statistical methods that can be used with Gaussian data. In this
tutorial, you will discover the Gaussian distribution, how to identify it, and how to calculate
key summary statistics of data drawn from this distribution. After completing this tutorial, you
will know:

```
 That the Gaussian distribution describes many observations, including many observations
seen during applied machine learning.
```

```
 That the central tendency of a distribution is the most likely observation and can be
estimated from a sample of data as the mean or median.
```

```
 That the variance is the average deviation from the mean in a distribution and can be
estimated from a sample of data as the variance and standard deviation.
```

```
Let’s get started.
```

### 4.2 Gaussian Distribution

A distribution of data refers to the shape it has when you graph it, such as with a histogram.
The most commonly seen and therefore well-known distribution of continuous values is the bell
curve. It is known as thenormaldistribution, because it the distribution that a lot of data falls
into. It is also known as the Gaussian distribution, more formally, named for Carl Friedrich
Gauss. As such, you will see references to data being normally distributed or Gaussian, which
are interchangeable, both referring to the same thing: that the data looks like the Gaussian
distribution. Some examples of observations that have a Gaussian distribution include:

```
 People’s heights.
```

```
 IQ scores.
```

```
 Body temperature.
```

```
Let’s look at a normal distribution. Below is some code to generate and plot an idealized
Gaussian distribution.
# generate and plot an idealized gaussian
from numpy import arange
from matplotlib import pyplot
from scipy.stats import norm
# x-axis for the plot
x_axis = arange(-3, 3, 0.001)
# y-axis as the gaussian
y_axis = norm.pdf(x_axis, 0, 1)
# plot data
pyplot.plot(x_axis, y_axis)
pyplot.show()
Listing 4.1: Example density line plot of Gaussian probability density function.
```

Running the example generates a plot of an idealized Gaussian distribution. The x-axis are
the observations and the y-axis is the likelihood of each observation. In this case, observations
around 0.0 are the most common and observations around -3.0 and 3.0 are rare or unlikely.
Technically, this is called a probability density function, covered in more detail in Chapter 10.

4.2. Gaussian Distribution 20

```
Figure 4.1: Density line plot of the Gaussian probability density function.
```

It is helpful when data is Gaussian or when we assume a Gaussian distribution for calculating
statistics. This is because the Gaussian distribution is very well understood. So much so that
large parts of the field of statistics are dedicated to methods for this distribution. Thankfully,
much of the data we work with in machine learning often fits a Gaussian distribution. Examples
include the input data we may use to fit a model and the multiple evaluations of a model on
different samples of training data. Not all data is Gaussian, and it is sometimes important to
make this discovery either by reviewing histogram plots of the data or using statistical tests to
check. Some examples of observations that do not fit a Gaussian distribution and instead may
fit an exponential (hockey-stick shape) include:

```
 People’s incomes.
```

```
 Population of cities.
```

```
 Sales of books.
```

A uniform distribution is another common distribution, often seen when each item or value
has an equal value for being selected. The shape of a graph of the uniform distribution is a flat
line.

```
4.3. Sample vs Population 21
```

### 4.3 Sample vs Population

We can think of data being generated by some unknown process. The data that we collect is
called a data sample, whereas all possible data that could be collected is called the population.

```
 Data Sample: A subset of observations from a group.
```

```
 Data Population: All possible observations from a group.
```

```
This is an important distinction because different statistical methods are used on samples vs
populations, and in applied machine learning, we are often working with samples of data. If you
read or use the wordpopulationwhen talking about data in machine learning, it very likely
means sample when it comes to statistical methods.
Two examples of data samples that you will encounter in machine learning include:
```

```
 The train and test datasets.
```

```
 The performance scores for a model.
```

```
When using statistical methods, we often want to make claims about the population using
only observations in the sample. Two clear examples of this include:
```

```
 The training sample must be representative of the population of observations so that we
can fit a useful model.
```

```
 The test sample must be representative of the population of observations so that we can
develop an unbiased evaluation of the model skill.
```

```
Because we are working with samples and making claims about a population, it means that
there is always some uncertainty, and it is important to understand and report this uncertainty.
```

### 4.4 Test Dataset

Before we explore some important summary statistics for data with a Gaussian distribution, let’s
first generate a sample of data that we can work with. We can use therandn()NumPy function
to generate a sample of random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution. There are two
key parameters that define any Gaussian distribution; they are the mean and the standard
deviation. We will go more into these parameters later as they are also key statistics to estimate
when we have data drawn from an unknown Gaussian distribution.
Therandn()function will generate a specified number of random numbers (e.g. 10,000)
drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. We can
then scale these numbers to a Gaussian of our choosing by rescaling the numbers. This can be
made consistent by adding the desired mean (e.g. 50) and multiplying the value by the standard
deviation (5). Note, generating random numbers is covered in greater detail in Chapter 6.
...
data = 5 \* randn(10000) + 50
Listing 4.2: Example of creating a sample of random Gaussian numbers.

```
4.4. Test Dataset 22
```

```
We can then plot the dataset using a histogram and look for the expected shape of the
plotted data. The complete example is listed below.
# generate a sample of random gaussians
from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from matplotlib import pyplot
# seed the random number generator
seed(1)
# generate univariate observations
data = 5 * randn(10000) + 50
# histogram of generated data
pyplot.hist(data)
pyplot.show()
Listing 4.3: Example of calculating and plotting the sample of Gaussian random numbers.
```

Running the example generates the dataset and plots it as a histogram. Simple plotting
is covered in Chapter 5. We can almost see the Gaussian shape to the data, but it is blocky.
This highlights an important point. Sometimes, the data will not be a perfect Gaussian, but
it will have a Gaussian-like distribution. It is almost Gaussian and maybe it would be more
Gaussian if it was plotted in a different way, scaled in some way, or if more data was gathered.
Often, when working with Gaussian-like data, we can treat it as Gaussian and use all of the
same statistical tools and get reliable results.

```
4.4. Test Dataset 23
```

```
Figure 4.2: Histogram of the sample of random Gaussian numbers.
```

```
In the case of this dataset, we do have enough data and the plot is blocky because the
plotting function chooses an arbitrary sized bucket for splitting up the data. We can choose a
different, more granular way to split up the data and better expose the underlying Gaussian
distribution. The updated example with the more refined plot is listed below.
# generate a sample of random gaussians
from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from matplotlib import pyplot
# seed the random number generator
seed(1)
# generate univariate observations
data = 5 * randn(10000) + 50
# histogram of generated data
pyplot.hist(data, bins=100)
pyplot.show()
```

```
Listing 4.4: Example of calculating and plotting the sample of Gaussian random numbers with
more bins.
```

Running the example, we can see that choosing 100 splits of the data does a much better
job of creating a plot that clearly shows the Gaussian distribution of the data. The dataset
was generated from a perfect Gaussian, but the numbers were randomly chosen and we only

```
4.5. Central Tendency 24
```

```
chose 10,000 observations for our sample. You can see, even with this controlled setup, there
is obvious noise in the data sample. This highlights another important point: that we should
always expect some noise or limitation in our data sample. The data sample will always contain
errors compared to the pure underlying distribution.
```

```
Figure 4.3: Histogram with more bins for the sample of random Gaussian numbers.
```

### 4.5 Central Tendency

The central tendency of a distribution refers to the middle or typical value in the distribution.
The most common or most likely value. In the Gaussian distribution, the central tendency is
called the mean, or more formally, the arithmetic mean, and is one of the two main parameters
that defines any Gaussian distribution. The mean of a sample is calculated as the sum of the
observations divided by the total number of observations in the sample.

```
mean(x) =
```

```
∑n
i=1xi
n
```

##### (4.1)

```
Wherexiis theithobservation from the dataset andnis the total number of observations.
```

```
4.5. Central Tendency 25
```

```
It is also written in a more compact form as:
```

```
mean(x) =
```

##### 1

```
n
```

##### ×

```
∑n
```

```
i=1
```

```
xi (4.2)
```

```
The notation for the population mean is the Greek lower case letter mu (μ). The notation
for the sample mean is the variable with a bar above, such as x-bar (x ̄). We can calculate the
mean of a sample by using themean()NumPy function on an array.
...
result = mean(data)
Listing 4.5: Example of calculating the mean in NumPy.
```

```
The example below demonstrates this on the test dataset developed in the previous section.
# calculate the mean of a sample
from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from numpy import mean
# seed the random number generator
seed(1)
# generate univariate observations
data = 5 * randn(10000) + 50
# calculate mean
result = mean(data)
print('Mean: %.3f'% result)
Listing 4.6: Example of calculating the mean of a data sample.
```

```
Running the example calculates and prints the mean of the sample. This calculation of
the arithmetic mean of the sample is an estimate of the parameter of the underlying Gaussian
distribution of the population from which the sample was drawn. As an estimate, it will contain
errors. Because we know the underlying distribution has the true mean of 50, we can see that
the estimate from a sample of 10,000 observations is reasonably accurate.
Mean: 50.049
Listing 4.7: Sample output from calculating the mean of a data sample.
```

The mean is easily influenced by outlier values, that is, rare values far from the mean.
These may be legitimately rare observations on the edge of the distribution or errors. Further,
the mean may be misleading. Calculating a mean on another distribution, such as a uniform
distribution or power distribution, may not make a lot of sense as although the value can be
calculated, it will refer to a seemingly arbitrary expected value rather than the true central
tendency of the distribution.
In the case of outliers or a non-Gaussian distribution, an alternate and commonly used
central tendency to calculate is the median. The median is calculated by first sorting all data
and then locating the middle value in the sample. This is straightforward if there is an odd
number of observations. If there is an even number of observations, the median is calculated
as the average of the middle two observations. We can calculate the median of a sample of an
array by calling themedian()NumPy function.
...
result = median(data)

```
4.6. Variance 26
```

```
Listing 4.8: Example of calculating the median in NumPy.
```

```
The example below demonstrates this on the test dataset.
# calculate the median of a sample
from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from numpy import median
# seed the random number generator
seed(1)
# generate univariate observations
data = 5 * randn(10000) + 50
# calculate median
result = median(data)
print('Median: %.3f' % result)
Listing 4.9: Example of calculating the median of a data sample.
```

Running the example, we can see that median is calculated from the sample and printed.
The result is not too dissimilar from the mean because the sample has a Gaussian distribution.
If the data had a different (non-Gaussian) distribution, the median may be very different from
the mean and perhaps a better reflection of the central tendency of the underlying population.
Median: 50.042
Listing 4.10: Sample output from calculating the median of a data sample.

### 4.6 Variance

The variance of a distribution refers to how much on average that observations vary or differ
from the mean value. It is useful to think of the variance as a measure of the spread of a
distribution. A low variance will have values grouped around the mean (e.g. a narrow bell
shape), whereas a high variance will have values spread out from the mean (e.g. a wide bell
shape.) We can demonstrate this with an example, by plotting idealized Gaussians with low
and high variance. The complete example is listed below.

# generate and plot gaussians with different variance

from numpy import arange
from matplotlib import pyplot
from scipy.stats import norm

# x-axis for the plot

x_axis = arange(-3, 3, 0.001)

# plot low variance

pyplot.plot(x_axis, norm.pdf(x_axis, 0, 0.5))

# plot high variance

pyplot.plot(x_axis, norm.pdf(x_axis, 0, 1))
pyplot.show()
Listing 4.11: Example of generating and plotting samples of random Gaussian numbers with
different variances.

```
Running the example plots two idealized Gaussian distributions: the blue with a low variance
grouped around the mean and the orange with a higher variance with more spread.
```

4.6. Variance 27

```
Figure 4.4: Line plots of Gaussian distributions with different variances.
```

The variance of a data sample drawn from a Gaussian distribution is calculated as the
average squared difference of each observation in the sample from the sample mean:

```
variance(x) =
```

##### 1

```
n− 1
```

##### ×

```
∑n
```

```
i=1
```

```
(xi−mean(x))^2 (4.3)
```

Wherevarianceis often denoted ass^2 or the lowercase Greek letter sigmaσ^2 , clearly showing
the squared units of the measure. You may see the equation without the (−1) from the number
of observations, and this is the calculation of the variance for the population, not the sample. We
can calculate the variance of a data sample in NumPy using thevar()function. The example
below demonstrates calculating variance on the test problem.

# calculate the variance of a sample

from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from numpy import var

# seed the random number generator

seed(1)

# generate univariate observations

data = 5 \* randn(10000) + 50

# calculate variance

result = var(data)

```
4.6. Variance 28
```

```
print('Variance: %.3f'% result)
Listing 4.12: Example of calculating the variance of a data sample.
```

```
Running the example calculates and prints the variance.
Variance: 24.939
Listing 4.13: Sample output from calculating the variance of a data sample.
```

```
It is hard to interpret the variance because the units are the squared units of the observations.
We can return the units to the original units of the observations by taking the square root of
the result. For example, the square root of 24.939 is about 4.9. Often, when the spread of a
Gaussian distribution is summarized, it is described using the square root of the variance. This
is called the standard deviation. The standard deviation, along with the mean, are the two key
parameters required to specify any Gaussian distribution.
We can see that the value of 4.9 is very close to the value of 5 for the standard deviation
specified when the samples were created for the test problem. We can wrap the variance
calculation in a square root to calculate the standard deviation directly.
```

```
stdev(x) =
```

##### √√

##### √

##### √^1

```
n− 1
```

##### ×

```
∑n
```

```
i=1
```

```
(xi−mean(x))^2 (4.4)
```

```
Or:
```

```
stdev(x) =
```

##### √

variance(x) (4.5)
Where the standard deviation is often written assor as the Greek lowercase letter sigma
(σ). The standard deviation can be calculated directly in NumPy for an array via thestd()
function. The example below demonstrates the calculation of the standard deviation on the test
problem.

# calculate the standard deviation of a sample

from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from numpy import std

# seed the random number generator

seed(1)

# generate univariate observations

data = 5 \* randn(10000) + 50

# calculate standard deviation

result = std(data)
print('Standard Deviation: %.3f'% result)
Listing 4.14: Example of calculating the standard deviation of a data sample.

```
Running the example calculates and prints the standard deviation of the sample. The value
matches the square root of the variance and is very close to 5.0, the value specified in the
definition of the problem.
Standard Deviation: 4.994
Listing 4.15: Sample output from calculating the standard deviation of a data sample.
```

```
4.7. Describing a Gaussian 29
```

```
Measures of variance can be calculated for non-Gaussian distributions, but generally require
the distribution to be identified so that a specialized measure of variance specific to that
distribution can be calculated.
```

### 4.7 Describing a Gaussian

In applied machine learning, you will often need to report the results of an algorithm. That is,
report the estimated skill of the model on out-of-sample data. This is often done by reporting
the mean performance from ak-fold cross-validation, or some other repeated sampling procedure.
When reporting model skill, you are in effect summarizing the distribution of skill scores, and
very likely the skill scores will be drawn from a Gaussian distribution.
It is common to only report the mean performance of the model. This would hide two
other important details of the distribution of the skill of the model. As a minimum I would
recommend reporting the two parameters of the Gaussian distribution of model scores and the
size of the sample. Ideally, it would also be a good idea to confirm that indeed the model skill
scores are Gaussian or look Gaussian enough to defend reporting the parameters of the Gaussian
distribution. This is important because the distribution of skill scores can be reconstructed by
readers and potentially compared to the skill of models on the same problem in the future.

In the next section, you will discover how to visualize data using simple charts and graphs.

Chapter 5

Simple Data Visualization

Sometimes data does not make sense until you can look at in a visual form, such as with charts
and plots. Being able to quickly visualize your data samples for yourself and others is an
important skill both in applied statistics and in applied machine learning. In this tutorial, you
will discover the five types of plots that you will need to know when visualizing data in Python
and how to use them to better understand your own data. After completing this tutorial, you
will know:

```
 How to chart time series data with line plots and categorical quantities with bar charts.
```

```
 How to summarize data distributions with histograms and box plots.
```

```
 How to summarize the relationship between variables with scatter plots.

```

### 5.2 Data Visualization

Data visualization is an important skill in applied statistics and machine learning. Statistics
does indeed focus on quantitative descriptions and estimations of data. Data visualization
provides an important suite of tools for gaining a qualitative understanding. This can be helpful
when exploring and getting to know a dataset and can help with identifying patterns, corrupt
data, outliers, and much more. With a little domain knowledge, data visualizations can be
used to express and demonstrate key relationships in plots and charts that are more visceral to
yourself and stakeholders than measures of association or significance.
Data visualization and exploratory data analysis are whole fields themselves and I will
recommend a deeper dive into some the books mentioned at the end. In this tutorial, let’s look
at basic charts and plots you can use to better understand your data. There are five key plots
that you need to know well for basic data visualization. They are the Line Plot, Bar Chart,
Histogram Plot, Box and Whisker Plot, and the Scatter Plot. With a knowledge of these plots,
you can quickly get a qualitative understanding of most data that you come across. For the rest
of this tutorial, we will take a closer look at each plot type.

### 5.3 Introduction to Matplotlib

There are many excellent plotting libraries in Python and I recommend exploring them in
order to create presentable graphics. For quick and dirty plots intended for your own use, I
recommend using the Matplotlib library. It is the foundation for many other plotting libraries
and plotting support in higher-level libraries such as Pandas. The Matplotlib provides a context,
one in which one or more plots can be drawn before the image is shown or saved to file. The
context can be accessed via functions onpyplot. The context can be imported as follows:

# import matplotlib context

from matplotlib import pyplot
...
Listing 5.1: Example of importing the Matplotlib context.

```
There is some convention to import this context and name itplt; for example:
# import matplotlib context
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
...
Listing 5.2: Example of alternate way of importing the Matplotlib context.
```

```
We will not use this convention, instead we will stick to the standard Python import
convention. Charts and plots are made by making and calling on context; for example:
...
# create a plot
pyplot.plot(...)
Listing 5.3: Example of creating a plot.
```

```
Elements such as axis, labels, legends, and so on can be accessed and configured on this
context as separate function calls. The drawings on the context can be shown in a new window
by calling theshow()function:
```

```
5.4. Line Plot 33
```

```
# display the plot
pyplot.show()
Listing 5.4: Example of displaying a plot.
```

```
Alternately, the drawings on the context can be saved to file, such as a PNG formatted
image file. Thesavefig()function can be used to save images.
```

```
# save plot to file
pyplot.savefig('my_image.png')
Listing 5.5: Example of saving a plot to file.
```

```
This is the most basic crash course for using the Matplotlib library. For more detail, see the
User Guide and other resources at the end of the tutorial.
```

### 5.4 Line Plot

A line plot is generally used to present observations collected at regular intervals. The x-axis
represents the regular interval, such as time. The y-axis shows the observations, ordered by the
x-axis and connected by a line. A line plot can be created by calling theplot()function and
passing the x-axis data for the regular interval, and y-axis for the observations.
...

# create line plot

pyplot.plot(x, y)
Listing 5.6: Example of creating a line plot.

Line plots are useful for presenting time series data as well as any sequence data where there
is an ordering between observations. The example below creates a sequence of 100 floating point
values as the x-axis and a sine wave as a function of the x-axis as the observations on the y-axis.
The results are plotted as a line plot.

```
# example of a line plot
from numpy import sin
from matplotlib import pyplot
# consistent interval for x-axis
x = [x*0.1 for x in range(100)]
# function of x for y-axis
y = sin(x)
# create line plot
pyplot.plot(x, y)
# show line plot
pyplot.show()
Listing 5.7: Example creating a line plot from data.
```

```
Running the example creates a line plot showing the familiar sine wave pattern on the y-axis
across the x-axis with a consistent interval between observations.
```

```
5.5. Bar Chart 34
```

```
Figure 5.1: Example of a line plot of data.
```

### 5.5 Bar Chart

A bar chart is generally used to present relative quantities for multiple categories. The x-axis
represents the categories and are spaced evenly. The y-axis represents the quantity for each
category and is drawn as a bar from the baseline to the appropriate level on the y-axis. A
bar chart can be created by calling thebar()function and passing the category names for the
x-axis and the quantities for the y-axis.

```
...
# create bar chart
pyplot.bar(x, y)
Listing 5.8: Example of creating a bar chart.
```

```
Bar charts can be useful for comparing multiple point quantities or estimations. The example
below creates a dataset with three categories, each defined with a string label. A single random
integer value is drawn for the quantity in each category.
# example of a bar chart
from random import seed
from random import randint
from matplotlib import pyplot
```

```
5.6. Histogram Plot 35
```

```
# seed the random number generator
seed(1)
# names for categories
x = ['red','green', 'blue']
# quantities for each category
y = [randint(0, 100), randint(0, 100), randint(0, 100)]
# create bar chart
pyplot.bar(x, y)
# show line plot
pyplot.show()
Listing 5.9: Example creating a bar chart from data.
```

```
Running the example creates the bar chart showing the category labels on the x-axis and
the quantities on the y-axis.
```

```
Figure 5.2: Example of a bar chart of data.
```

### 5.6 Histogram Plot

A histogram plot is generally used to summarize the distribution of a data sample. The x-axis
represents discrete bins or intervals for the observations. For example observations with values
between 1 and 10 may be split into five bins, the values [1,2] would be allocated to the first bin,

[3,4] would be allocated to the second bin, and so on. The y-axis represents the frequency or
count of the number of observations in the dataset that belong to each bin. Essentially, a data
sample is transformed into a bar chart where each category on the x-axis represents an interval
of observation values.

```
Histograms are density estimates. A density estimate gives a good impression of
the distribution of the data.[...] The idea is to locally represent the data density by
counting the number of observations in a sequence of consecutive intervals (bins) ...

```

A histogram plot can be created by calling thehist()function and passing in a list or array
that represents the data sample.

...

# create histogram plot

pyplot.hist(x)

```
Listing 5.10: Example of creating a histogram plot.
```

Histograms are valuable for summarizing the distribution of data samples. The example
below creates a dataset of 1,000 random numbers drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution,
then plots the dataset as a histogram.

# example of a histogram plot

from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from matplotlib import pyplot

# seed the random number generator

seed(1)

# random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution

x = randn(1000)

# create histogram plot

pyplot.hist(x)

# show line plot

pyplot.show()

```
Listing 5.11: Example creating a histogram plot from data.
```

Running the example, we can see that the shape of the bars shows the bell-shaped curve
of the Gaussian distribution. We can see that the function automatically chose the number of
bins, in this case splitting the values into groups by integer value.

```

```

```

```
Often, careful choice of the number of bins can help to better expose the shape of the data
distribution. The number of bins can be specified by setting thebinsargument; for example:
```

```
# create histogram plot with specified bins
pyplot.hist(x, bins=100)
Listing 5.12: Example of creating a histogram plot with a specific number of bins.
```

### 5.7 Box and Whisker Plot

A box and whisker plot, or boxplot for short, is generally used to summarize the distribution of
a data sample. The x-axis is used to represent the data sample, where multiple boxplots can be
drawn side by side on the x-axis if desired.
The y-axis represents the observation values. A box is drawn to summarize the middle
50% of the dataset starting at the observation at the 25th percentile and ending at the 75th
percentile. The median, or 50th percentile, is drawn with a line. A value called the interquartile
range, or IQR, is calculated as 1.5 \* the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles. Lines
called whiskers are drawn extending from both ends of the box with the length of the IQR to

```

demonstrate the expected range of sensible values in the distribution. Observations outside the
whiskers might be outliers and are drawn with small circles.

```
The boxplot is a graphical technique that displays the distribution of variables. It
helps us see the location, skewness, spread, tile length and outlying points. [...] The
boxplot is a graphical representation of the Five Number Summary.
```

```
— Page 5,Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, 2015.
```

```
Boxplots can be drawn by calling theboxplot()function passing in the data sample as an
array or list.
...
# create box and whisker plot
pyplot.boxplot(x)
Listing 5.13: Example of creating a box and whisker plot.
```

```
Boxplots are useful to summarize the distribution of a data sample as an alternative to the
histogram. They can help to quickly get an idea of the range of common and sensible values
in the box and in the whisker respectively. Because we are not looking at the shape of the
distribution explicitly, this method is often used when the data has an unknown or unusual
distribution, such as non-Gaussian.
The example below creates three boxplots in one chart, each summarizing a data sample
drawn from a slightly different Gaussian distribution. Each data sample is created as an array
and all three data sample arrays are added to a list that is padded to the plotting function.
# example of a box and whisker plot
from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from matplotlib import pyplot
# seed the random number generator
seed(1)
# random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution
x = [randn(1000), 5 * randn(1000), 10 * randn(1000)]
# create box and whisker plot
pyplot.boxplot(x)
# show line plot
pyplot.show()
Listing 5.14: Example creating a box and whisker plot from data.
```

```
Running the example creates a chart showing the three box and whisker plots. We can see
that the same scale is used on the y-axis for each, making the first plot look squashed and the
last plot look spread out. In this case, we can see the black box for the middle 50% of the data,
the orange line for the median, the lines for the whiskers summarizing the range of sensible
data, and finally dots for the possible outliers.
```

```
5.8. Scatter Plot 39
```

```
Figure 5.4: Example of a box and whisker plot of data.
```

### 5.8 Scatter Plot

A scatter plot, or scatterplot, is generally used to summarize the relationship between two
paired data samples. Paired data samples means that two measures were recorded for a given
observation, such as the weight and height of a person. The x-axis represents observation values
for the first sample, and the y-axis represents the observation values for the second sample.
Each point on the plot represents a single observation.

```
Scatterplots are bivariate or trivariate plots of variables against each other. They
help us understand relationships among the variables of a dataset. A downward-
sloping scatter indicates that as we increase the variable on the horizontal axis, the
variable on the vertical axis decreases.
```

```
— Page 19,Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, 2015.
```

```
Scatter plots can be created by calling thescatter()function and passing the two data
sample arrays.
...
# create scatter plot
```

```
5.8. Scatter Plot 40
```

```
pyplot.scatter(x, y)
Listing 5.15: Example of creating a scatter plot.
```

Scatter plots are useful for showing the association or correlation between two variables. A
correlation can be quantified, such as a line of best fit, that too can be drawn as a line plot on
the same chart, making the relationship clearer. A dataset may have more than two measures
(variables or columns) for a given observation. A scatter plot matrix is a cart containing scatter
plots for each pair of variables in a dataset with more than two variables. The example below
creates two data samples that are related. The first is a sample of random numbers drawn
from a standard Gaussian. The second is dependent upon the first by adding a second random
Gaussian value to the value of the first measure.

# example of a scatter plot

from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from matplotlib import pyplot

# seed the random number generator

seed(1)

# first variable

x = 20 \* randn(1000) + 100

# second variable

y = x + (10 \* randn(1000) + 50)

# create scatter plot

pyplot.scatter(x, y)

# show line plot

pyplot.show()
Listing 5.16: Example creating a scatter plot from data.

```
Running the example creates the scatter plot, showing the positive relationship between
the two variables. We will learn more about describing the relationships between variables in
Chapter 12.

Random Numbers

```
Randomness is a big part of machine learning. Randomness is used as a tool or a feature in
preparing data and in learning algorithms that map input data to output data in order to make
predictions. In order to understand the need for statistical methods in machine learning, you
must understand the source of randomness in machine learning. The source of randomness in
machine learning is a mathematical trick called a pseudorandom number generator. In this
tutorial, you will discover pseudorandom number generators and when to control and control-for
randomness in machine learning. After completing this tutorial, you will know:
